Assignment 3 from Game Development Foundations of Mohawk College's Game Design Program. This project is a 2D Game. I'm going to recreate T-Rex Runner with a couple of new added challenges thrown into the mix.

Bounty Runner is a variant of T-Rex Runner.
The Controls are:
A / Left Arrow Key moves the Player Left
D / Right Arrow Key moves the Player Right
W / Up Arrow Key moves the Player Up
